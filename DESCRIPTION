Description: The package presents a set of tools to assess cumulative impacts
    of anthropogenic infrastructure and activity on biodiversity. This includes
    tools to calculate the zone of influence (ZoI) of infrastructure as well as 
    tools for model fitting, estimation of the effect size and ZoI, and 
    ancillary functions. The functions dealing with spatial data processing can 
    be run in both R and GRASS GIS, using R as an interface.
