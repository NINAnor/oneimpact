Description: The package presents a set of tools to assess cumulative impacts
    of anthropogenic infrastructure and activity on biodiversity. This includes
    tools to calculate the zone of influence (ZoI) of infrastructure, as well as 
    tools for model fitting and determination of the ZoI and ancillary functions.
    The functions dealing with spatial data processing can be run in both R and
    GRASS GIS, using R as an interface.
