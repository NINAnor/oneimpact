\description{
Raster data with multiple layers representing predictor environmental variables
for the Hardangervidda wild reindeer areas in Norway, used for the vignettes and
the illustration example in Niebuhr et al. 2023.
Comprises multiple layers: land cover, four components of a principal component
analysis which represent bio-geo-climatic variation, and 28 layers representing
the cumulative zone of influence (ZOI) and the ZOI of the nearest feature for
private cottages and public tourist resources, with radii from 100 m to 20 km.
The raster has 500 m resolution.
